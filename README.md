# Expense Tracker
The application can be viwed [here](https://khara-expense-tracker.herokuapp.com/). The primary purpose of this project was to use my knowledge of the differnt technologies in the MERN stack and bring them all together into a single application.
Hence, this web app is brocken down into two parts, client and server. The client is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) ([w/ Redux](https://redux.js.org/)) 
and the server is built using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) ([w/ express](https://expressjs.com/)). 
At the rudimentary level, this web app helps users keep track of their expenses. But the goal of this project is to learn and apply different web technologies instead of competing with other expense trackers (like Expensify). Let us discuss all the technologies I have used for the different features of the application.
